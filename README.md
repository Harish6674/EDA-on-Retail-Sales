# EDA-on-Retail-Sales
Excited to share insights from my Task-1 project that I have completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte!.Where I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail sales data using Python!
🔍 Understanding the Data: Loaded, cleaned, and explored relevant features such as order details, segments, categories, and sales info.
📈 Feature Engineering: Engineered new features including profit margins, fulfillment times, and analyzed discounts' impact on net profit.
📉 Visualizing Trends: Used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize trends over time, regional sales distributions, and product category performances.
🔢 Statistical Analysis: Employed descriptive statistics to identify patterns, anomalies, and growth rates, offering insights into sales dynamics.
📊 Key Findings: Uncovered annual sales trends, regional sales distributions, and the impact of discounts on net profits across product categories.
🚀 Takeaways & Next Steps: This EDA provides actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies, inventory management, and pricing decisions to drive profitability and enhance customer experience.
📚 Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Let's connect to discuss further insights from this project!
